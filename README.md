This is my repo for the cat/dog project. I didn't use pylearn2, because I wanted to get used to Theano. I also wanted to have implemented a full neural network and all its training tricks at least once in my life.

Here are the most important files:
    - networks.py : the network architectures used for the project.
    - nn.py : the layers and the network classes.
    - train_multi.py : the main training script.
